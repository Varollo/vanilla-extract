## **Introduction**

**Varollo's Vanilla Extract** is a modpack aimed at bringing the most enhanced vanilla experience.

The pack uses the Fabric API and comes loaded with lots of performance improvement mods aswell as Iris Shaders, for you shader-maniacs!

There are ~~currently~~ no tool mods (ex. Tinkers Construct, Tetra, etc). This is on purpose as to keep the vanilla enchantment system and allow other mods to shine where they couldn't before, but this may change in the future depending on the demand!

---

## Minimum Requirements
**THIS IS NOT A LIGHTWEIGHT PACK**
* At least 6GB of allocated RAM, the rest should be fine as long as you are not playing on a potato.

## Known Issues
* At first login, the spawn chunk is dark, this should be fixed by interacting with any block causing a block update
* Also when you first load into the world you may experience insane lag spikes, which will go away as the chunks finish generating

---
